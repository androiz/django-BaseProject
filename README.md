# django-BaseProject
This project is a django base-project. It's useful so as to start a project because you have well 
developed a module for signup & login with an user-extended profile. Functionalities in the project 
include: 

* A signup/login system.
* An user profile with avatar.
* A user-friendly interface based on Boostrap.

## Installation

In order to make this project work, it's necessary to build a virtual environment with a version of Python 2.7.

Afterwards, you just have to load the virtualenv and type the command below:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then, you will need a user-admin so you have to run the command:

`python manage.py createsuperuser`

(Signup is based on the email address so I recommend setting up the username with the same email address too)

Then, run the server with the next command:

`python manage.py runserver`

Finally, the superuser is not created with a user-extended profile, so you should create a basic user-profile
for him manually. To do that, just go to **127.0.0.1/admin** and **create manually the user-profile** record matching with
the superuser.

**Additional Information:**

When users are registered in the web site, their active field is set up to False (because we are waiting for receiving
an activation email) so that the superuser should activate manually to make them work.
